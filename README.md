# 🚀 GitIQ

### 🧠 AI-Powered GitHub Portfolio Analyzer & Enhancer

GitIQ is an AI-driven GitHub portfolio evaluation platform designed to help developers understand, optimize, and showcase their coding profiles more effectively. By analyzing repositories, contribution patterns, documentation quality, and engineering practices, GitIQ generates intelligent scoring insights and personalized improvement recommendations that help developers transform their GitHub into a strong professional portfolio.


---

## ❗ The Problem

Developers often use GitHub as their primary portfolio, but evaluating portfolio strength objectively is difficult:

### 📁 Portfolio Quality Ambiguity

Developers create multiple repositories but lack clarity about which projects actually demonstrate strong engineering skills.

### 📚 Documentation Neglect

Many repositories lack proper README files, usage instructions, or project explanation, reducing recruiter confidence.

### 📈 Contribution Misinterpretation

Commit frequency alone does not reflect consistency, project impact, or real contribution quality.

### 🧩 Skill Representation Gaps

Developers struggle to understand whether their GitHub reflects modern technology adoption or professional engineering practices.

### 🚫 Lack of Actionable Feedback

GitHub provides activity tracking but does not provide personalized guidance for improvement.
